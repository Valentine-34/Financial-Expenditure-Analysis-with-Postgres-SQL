This is a  postgres sql project that involved creating a database, creating tables within that same database
and then populating the tables with data(all of this was done with the GUI in postgres SQL) that was previously cleaned using excel. After the data had been imported into 
the tables, primary keys and foreign keys were defined and relations were created between them. The rest was exploration.
