This is a  postgres sql project that involved creating a database, creating tables within that same database
and then populating the tables with data(all of this was done with the GUI in postgres SQL) that was previously cleaned using excel. After the data had been imported into 
the tables, primary keys and foreign keys were defined and relations were created between them. Most of the data cleaning part of this project was done in excel, but postgres saw some cleaning too. 
The final part was exploration.
